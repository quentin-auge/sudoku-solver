# Sudoku solver

Solve a sudoku grid by [modeling it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exact_cover#Sudoku) as an [exact cover problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exact_cover) and using [algorithm X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%27s_Algorithm_X).

It allows for fast enumeration of all possible solutions.

This is state of the arts when implementing algorithm X with [dancing links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dancing_Links). Those are, however, kept out of scope of the present project, for the sake of simplicity. A sparse representation of the cover matrix based on dict and sets is used. Performance is satifying enough.

## Requirements

Python >= 3.7 (featuring dataclasses).  
`numpy` and `matplotlib` are the only extra dependencies.

## Examples

You can find an interactive version of this README in jupyter notebook [sudoku.ipynb](sudoku.ipynb).

### Provided grids

```python
import numpy as np
from sudoku import plot_grid, solve_grid

sudoku_filepath = 'data/test_2020_04.npz'

for grid_id in range(3):
    print('Grid', grid_id + 1)

    # Load grid

    sudoku = np.load(sudoku_filepath, allow_pickle=True)['sudokus'][grid_id]

    # Extract grid

    grid = sudoku['grid']
    group_grid = sudoku['group_grid']

    # Display grid

    plot_grid(grid, group_grid)

    # Solve grid

    solution_grid = solve_grid(grid, group_grid)
    plot_grid(solution_grid, group_grid)
    
    print()
```

### Classical grid

grid = np.array(grid)

### Multi-solution grid

4x4 grid for easier reading

```python
import numpy as np
from sudoku import get_cover_matrix, solve_matrix, fill_grid, plot_grid

grid = [
    [1, 2, 0, 3],
    [0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0],
    [2, 0, 3, 4]
]

group_grid = [
    [1, 1, 2, 2],
    [1, 1, 2, 2],
    [3, 3, 4, 4],
    [3, 3, 4, 4]
]

grid = np.array(grid)
group_grid = np.array(group_grid)

plot_grid(grid, group_grid)

matrix = get_cover_matrix(grid, group_grid)
solutions = solve_matrix(matrix, [])

for i, solution in enumerate(solutions, 1):
    print('Solution', i)
    solution_grid = fill_grid(grid, solution)
    plot_grid(solution_grid, group_grid)
```
